## [1.4.1](https://github.com/sketchbuch/vsc-workspace-sidebar/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1) (2022-03-24)

- Fixes an issue that workspaces in the root directory were not displayed in tree view. Resolves [#47](https://github.com/sketchbuch/vsc-workspace-sidebar/issues/47)
- Tree generation has been changed so that sorting of sub folders and files is possible. In 1.4.0 folders always came before workspaces.
- A config setting has been added to decide if the tree should be condensed or not (default is true). Condensing removes subfolders if they are no further subfolders and there is only one workspace file within it. The Workspace is then displayed in their parent folder to reduce visual noise if you only ever have one workspace per folder.
- Added more tests, refactored tests and improved file/file tree mocks

- A new option has been added to clean labels (convert to title case) or leave them as-is (like the filename). Resolves [#42](https://github.com/sketchbuch/vsc-workspace-sidebar/issues/42)
- If no workspace is open, any folder(s) that you open will be displayed in the sidebar and you can also save them as a new workspace. Resolves [#30](https://github.com/sketchbuch/vsc-workspace-sidebar/issues/30)
- Refactor/restructure of code
- Additional unit tests
- @vscode/webview-ui-toolkit is now used for buttons. Search box still needs converting.
- @vscode/codicons is now used for icons, where possible.
- Icons updated
- Fixed tooltips for the icon an dthe workspace if you make new window the default click action.
